  I've always been interested in games, digital worlds that can captivate and provide a sense of wonder and awe.
Both the visual aspects and the technical aspects have always caught my attention and I had to feed my curiosity
about their functions and what made them possible.  
  The first foray was into 3D graphics production and learning
those skills and how they intertwine with Game Engines taught me that the artistic side of Game Development is
heavily integrated with the technical side.  From the render engine, to the physics engine and everything in
between, the technical side governs what is possible on the artistic side.
  With this in mind, my future plans include learning the programing skills necessary to create and modify each
aspect of a Game Engine and possibly get to the point of building a Game Engine from the ground up.  No easy feat
depending on the complexity of the graphics desired and the complexity of the game it is geared towards.
